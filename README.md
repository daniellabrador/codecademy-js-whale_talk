## Project Prompt

Take a phrase like `‘turpentine and turtles’` and translate it into its “whale talk” equivalent: `‘UUEEIEEAUUEE’`.

There are a few simple rules for translating text to whale language:

- There are no consonants. Only vowels excluding “y”.
- The `u`‘s and `e`‘s are extra long, so we must double them in our program.
Once we have converted text to the whale language, the result is sung slowly, as is a custom in the ocean.

## Technologies

- JavaScript ES6

## Setup

To run this program, you need install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to your machine.
